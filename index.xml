      <description>With the relatively recent release Go 1.5, there are a variety of interesting areas to look at in regards to what&amp;rsquo;s changed with the language. As one would expect based on both Go&amp;rsquo;s philosophy and it&amp;rsquo;s future compatibility guidelines, not much has changed from a language feature standpoint. Still, there a number of exciting under-the-hood enhancements in the latest release.
Package system New functionality has been introduced to the packaging system in two ways.</description>

      <title>Linking Dynamic C&#43;&#43; Libraries with Go</title>

      <description>These days, I spend a lot of time working with, designing, and implementing APIs. Since Meta is a microservices based application, the contracts that those APIs provide are crucial to designing the interactions with them. Quickly, maintaining good documentation and client libraries becomes nearly as important of a part of the applications as the code itself. Each step forward in functionality must provide solid footing to keep on building.</description>

      <description>My previous site was written completely from scratch. It gave me a valuable understanding of web fundamentals, but as my time grows short, I needed something with a little more tooling built in. Still, I wanted tools that I could understand. After working extensively with Go in my work at Meta, I felt I had a good enough understanding of its templating system to commit to using it as a the building blocks for my own website.</description>

      <description>During the spring of my sophomore year at Williams College I took a project-based distributed systems course. Over the course of the semester in partner projects I worked on server from scratch written in C using a queue-based model to handle requests in a highly resilient manner, a multi-server e-commerce system with an iOS client communicating over XML-RPC, and set up a Hadoop cluster to analyze advertising data, correlating customers to impressions.</description>

      <description>Created the fastest assembly language interpreter in my Computer Architecture class for large programs by compiling instructions read commands of the x86 instruction set into mappes sequences of ARM instructions which allowed loops to be executed much faster than if they had to be interpreted every time.</description>
