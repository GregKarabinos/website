            Started a company after pitching at and winning the annual Williams College Business Plan Competition. Formed a team of 5 other CS majors, paid to work full-time last summer. I lead development of full-stack mobile application for iOS and Android with a Ruby on Rails backend, taking part in creating every piece of the project. Four servers run the webservice in a distributed environment and the application is now live on the iOS App Store. Peck is a social calendaring service for college students providing information and event-based communication within groups. I designed a robust system for repetitively scraping websites of any format for reliable integrations with the front end of any existing calendaring system.
