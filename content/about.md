I am a full-stack developer with a track record of delivering on ambitious projects in both a professional and academic setting. As a cofounder of Peck, I lead a team of developers in the development of a mobile application and web service. I aspire to maintain a holistic vision for a product while managing and participating in the development process. I have experience with a wide variety of technologies that provide me with a strong basis for designing and developing computer systems. I have studied Computer Science at Williams College and the Aquincum Institute of Technology, and am currently taking time off from school to work on a startup in Boston.


## Experience
### Co-Founder and CTO, Meta
#### January 2015 - present
Developing a cloud platform that brings the power of a search engine to a user's own files. Architecting a service-based backend to provide a single user experience for file search and organization. It analyzes files with a similar intent to how a search engine would analyze the web, providing SmartTags based on found concepts and ideas.

### iPhone app development, Williams Computer Science Department
#### Spring 2013 - present
Created an app, HungryEph, to provide a simpler and more intuitive interface for daily and late night snack bar menus that uses data scraped from the existing online dining resources. Currently in use by Williams students.

## Projects
### Compiling Interpreter for x86 machine code written in ARM assembly language
Created the fastest interpreter in my Computer Architecture class by compiling translated instructions of the x86 instruction set into mapped sequences of ARM instructions allowing for much faster runtimes.
### Replicated Hosting within a P2P Marketplace
Forked the OpenBazaar project in its early stages to emulate a hosted site environment within a P2P network. Used a Kademlia distributed hash table to facilitate replicated storage of a user’s site across multiple peers.
### Electric Powered Off-Road Vehicle - Summer 2011 - Fall 2013
Hand-fabricated a full-suspension metal frame from raw steel tubing. Designed the power train electronics system, used CAD software to design and fabricate control board, motor mount, and drivetrain assembly.
