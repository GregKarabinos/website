I am a full-stack developer with a track record of delivering on ambitious projects in both a professional and academic setting. As a cofounder of Peck, I lead a team of developers in the development of a mobile application and web service. I aspire to maintain a holistic vision for a product while managing and participating in the development process. I have experience with a wide variety of technologies that provide me with a strong basis for designing and developing computer systems. I have studied Computer Science at Williams College and the Aquincum Institute of Technology, and am currently taking time off from school to work on a startup in Boston.
