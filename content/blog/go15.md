With the relatively recent release Go 1.5, there are a variety of interesting areas to look at in regards to what's changed with the language. As one would expect based on [future compatibility](http://golang.org/doc/go1compat), not much has changed from a language feature standpoint. Still, there a number of extremely exciting under-the-hood enhancements in the latest release.

### Package system

New functionality has been introduced to the packaging system in two ways. First, support for [internal packages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8kOo3r51b2BWtTs_1uADIA5djfXhPT36s6eHVRIvaU/edit) has been brought out of it's experimental phase in Go 1.4 where it was being testing within GOROOT to now apply to packages within the GOPATH.

The second addition to the packaging system was experimental [support for vendored](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo/edit) packages...

### Compiler and Runtime written in Go

The entire go tool chain has been overhauled to be written entirely in Go. Previously, much of go was written in C because it provided a much easier path to get started with a new language. The bootstrapping process for Go was much easier because it could be built with just a C compiler. Still, the reasons were listed in a 2013 [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3BLR31VA8cvLJLfMibSuTdwTuF7WWLux71CYD0eeD8/edit) of this change.

> - It is easier to write correct Go code than to write correct C code.
> - It is easier to debug incorrect Go code than to debug incorrect C code.
> - Work on a Go compiler necessarily requires a good understanding of Go. Implementing the compiler in C adds an unnecessary second requirement.
> - Go makes parallel execution trivial compared to C.
> - Go has better standard support than C for modularity, for automated rewriting, for unit testing, and for profiling.
> - Go is much more fun to use than C.

This change was primarily facilitated by an automated translation process, with certain code translated by hand. The process is detailed in Rob Pike's Go to Go [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1zJYkBW4A) and [slides](https://talks.golang.org/2015/gogo.slide) which steps through the motivation, history, and how this translation took place.

There are also a variety of [new tools](https://golang.org/doc/go1.5#tools) in Go 1.5 that were much [easier](https://talks.golang.org/2015/gogo.slide#6) or newly possible due to this change. Some of them, including stack maps, [continuous stacks](http://agis.io/2014/03/25/contiguous-stacks-in-go.html), and write barriers were nearly impossible to accomplish previously with C in the tool chain because of a lack of type safety and uncertainty that optimizations in C compilers introduce, limiting what's possible for an external language (Go) to accomplish.

As one might expect, C code that is literally translated into Go would not be optimally efficient. After some basic cleaning up of the raw translation using a purpose-specific tool called [grind](https://godoc.org/rsc.io/grind), the translation was still around ten times slower than the C compiler it was based on. Most of this slowdown was solved through further optimization of c-specific patterns such as complex for loops, treatment of stack variables, unions converted to bloated structs, misplaced declarations on unused variables, and more, which were converted into more idiomatic and efficient forms.

Still, in the short term this switch has slowed the Go compilation process by about a factor of two. However, what the translation process did preserve perfectly was the correctness of the compiler, thus avoiding the introduction of new bugs that would inevitably come with a rewrite. In this way, the translated code can be incrementally improved through more idiomatic use of the language to bring performance of the already lightning fast compilation up to where it was previously.

### True Parallelism

The changes I am most excited about in Go 1.5 are the performance improvements. If you're a more experienced Gopher, you've most likely seen Rob Pike's talk, [Concurrency is not Parallelism](https://youtu.be/cN_DpYBzKso), which explains the important distinction between these concepts. Previously, Go offered a default of concurrency without parallelism. In the latest release, that default has changed.

The technical change that occurred was switching [`GOMAXPROCS`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS), the maximum  number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously, from it's previous default value of 1 to the number of logical CPUs. The default of one was the logical choice up until now. Due to some limitations in the goroutine scheduler, programs in earlier versions of Go would often get slower when parallelism was introduced by raising `GOMAXPROCS`. The [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1At2Ls5_fhJQ59kDK2DFVhFu3g5mATSXqqV5QrxinasI/edit0) on this change illustrates how the performance of a number of reference algorithms has steadily improved when they are parallelized, including in worst case scenarios that are particularly difficult to deal with.

Because of Go's emphasis on concurrency primarily as a design technique, it wasn't a logical step to enable parallelism by default if it would punish those programs that used concurrency in ways that may not be inherently parallel, or are difficult to parallelize efficiently.

There were a number of improvements that enabled this shift...

### GC overhaul improvements

### Google App Engine support

At [Meta](https://www.meta.sc) we use Google App Engine to host the majority of our infrastructure as I've [blogged about](https://www.meta.sc/tech/startclean/). We are very much looking forward to the availability of Go 1.5 on App Engine, and is [planned](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/as9wUqT77YU), but unfortunately there is [no definitive date](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/Vg5F0sUMTFc) as of yet. We'll be moving to is as soon as it's available!

### Conclusions

Go 1.5 solidifies the Go tool chain and brings performance improvements that increase it's competitiveness as a high-performance language. There are plenty of other changes that I didn't get a chance to touch on, so be sure to take a look at the full [Go 1.5 Release Notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.5) for other details.
